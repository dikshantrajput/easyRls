EasyRls is an open-source project designed to simplify the management of Row
Level Security (RLS) policies in PostgreSQL databases. With EasyRls, you can
easily connect to your PostgreSQL instance, manage schemas and tables, and
create, edit, or delete RLS policiesâ€”all through an intuitive interface that
supports both light and dark themes.
